# Student Management in C

The Project **Student Management System** in C manages students data. It can save the student details like:-

*  Student name. 
* Student's id.
* Student's course.
* Student's course fee.
* Student's Phone Number.
* Student's Address.
* Student's Email.

# Objectives

* Provides security from unauthorized access, only admin or authorized users are granted access to the system.

* To design a robust system which creates user friendly environment, where a normal user can easily access through all the benefits of the system.
 
# System Analysis

### Existing System

* Adding record is not easy as the user has to scroll down to the end of the document to enter a new record or needs to find the alphabetically correct position to enter a new record.

* When required, records are needed to be found manually which is not an easy task is if the number of records are more.

### Proposed System

All of the problems in the existing system can be solved by developing a software that can save student records automatically in a file by taking input from user and display them, search for record specified by the user and should also delete the record from the file if the user wishes to do so.

# System Design

The software contains the following functions:-

*  Add_student()
*  View_student()
*   Search_student()
*   Edit_student()
*   Delete_student()
*   Changepassword()

## Future Scope and Further Enhancement

* Application can be modified to export the records of an employee in printable format or transferable format which can be added to application in another computer.

* The application can be modified to sync the records with our mobile phone and Google accounts, Facebook account, etc.
